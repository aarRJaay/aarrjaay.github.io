      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;thought&#34;&gt;Thought&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The people of Israel are in a place of uncertainty, they’re lost, they’re exiled and have no idea of how they’re going to get out of their situation, it would have looked dire, unknown, but in their place of unknowing, God offers to take them on a journey if they’ll follow.  He hasn’t given up on them in their ‘blindness’, they had closed their eyes to their God and wandered far away, God is offering to lead them back to Him.  He hasn’t forsaken them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
