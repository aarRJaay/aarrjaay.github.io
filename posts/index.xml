      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, we had our scan just over an hour ago and what we thought would be an 8 week embryo, was just 5 weeks.  There&amp;rsquo;s no way this is a miscalculation on our part because Eleanor is regular, and because she&amp;rsquo;s had pregnancy symptoms for the whole 8 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re devistated and having an hour long drive home was full of numbness, sighs and me beign on auto-pilot the whole way home.  We have a midwife appointment tomorrow which was supposed to be our &amp;lsquo;Booking&amp;rsquo; appointment where we register and &amp;lsquo;Book In&amp;rsquo; with the midwife, talk about our medica histories and get into the system, Eleanor has called them so they&amp;rsquo;re aware of our situation and can change the appointment as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It started with Eleanor not feeling great for a few days straight and someone at her work suggested that she may be pregnant.  We HAD been trying but it was waaaay too soon for her to be having any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing is, it&amp;rsquo;s crazy how long you need to wait until any kind of medical advice. We thought you&amp;rsquo;d need to book in with a doctor, get connected to a midwife, arrange a scan.  Nope!  None of that until 8  weeks.  We thought we&amp;rsquo;d at least be given an &amp;lsquo;official&amp;rsquo; pregnancy test rather than relying on weeing on a stick (4 times!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, today we get to see our little one for the first time.  We decided to have an 8 week scan, just to make sure everything is okay and to see how many we&amp;rsquo;re having as our risk of multiple births is quite high to due my wife&amp;rsquo;s age.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to see our little one, but it&amp;rsquo;s mixed with some apprehension - this is technically called a &amp;lsquo;Viability Scan&amp;rsquo; which is part of what we want to see - we need to be sure that our little one is okay.  We&amp;rsquo;ve known we&amp;rsquo;ve been pregnant for pretty much the whole 8 weeks as Eleanor had symptoms from almost &amp;lsquo;Day 1&amp;rsquo; and Eleanor is still experiencing symptoms but we just want to check - we&amp;rsquo;ve had one friend who recently had a miscarrage and another with a &amp;lsquo;missed&amp;rsquo; miscarrage so we want to be super-sure things are as they should be at this early stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
