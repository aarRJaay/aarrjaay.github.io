      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, today we get to see our little one for the first time.  We decided to have an 8 week scan, just to make sure everything is okay and to see how many we&amp;rsquo;re having as our risk of multiple births is quite high to due my wife&amp;rsquo;s age.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to see our little one, but it&amp;rsquo;s mixed with some apprehension - this is technically called a &amp;lsquo;Viability Scan&amp;rsquo; which is part of what we want to see - we need to be sure that our little one is okay.  We&amp;rsquo;ve known we&amp;rsquo;ve been pregnant for pretty much the whole 8 weeks as Eleanor had symptoms from almost &amp;lsquo;Day 1&amp;rsquo; and Eleanor is still experiencing symptoms but we just want to check - we&amp;rsquo;ve had one friend who recently had a miscarrage and another with a &amp;lsquo;missed&amp;rsquo; miscarrage so we want to be super-sure things are as they should be at this early stage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We HAD been trying but it was waaaay too soon for her to be having any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;The thing is, it&amp;#39;s crazy how long you need to wait until any kind of medical advice. We thought you&amp;#39;d need to book in with a doctor, get connected to a midwife, arrange a scan.  Nope!  None of that until 8  weeks.  We thought we&amp;#39;d at least be given an &amp;#39;official&amp;#39; pregnancy test rather than relying on weeing on a stick (4 times!).  &lt;/p&gt;</description>
