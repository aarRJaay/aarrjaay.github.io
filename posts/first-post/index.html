    <p>It started with Eleanor not feeling great for a few days straight and someone at her work suggested that she may be pregnant.  We HAD been trying but it was waaaay too soon for her to be having any symptoms.</p>
<p>The thing is, it&rsquo;s crazy how long you need to wait until any kind of medical advice. We thought you&rsquo;d need to book in with a doctor, get connected to a midwife, arrange a scan.  Nope!  None of that until 8  weeks.  We thought we&rsquo;d at least be given an &lsquo;official&rsquo; pregnancy test rather than relying on weeing on a stick (4 times!).</p>
<p>So we wait.  Wait through the symptoms of <del>morning</del> pregnancy sickness until we can book our midwife appointment.</p>
<p>We have booked an early (viability) scan as we really want to be sure early on, one, that the baby is as okay as it can be at this early stage, and two, to check that we aren&rsquo;t having more than one.  My wife, being older, is &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; of having twins (there&rsquo;s no sign of that in either of our families, but we&rsquo;d at least like to know).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only told some very close Christian friends to support us in prayer, and Eleanor&rsquo;s direct family.  We&rsquo;ll be telling my family after the 12 week scan which is when we&rsquo;re past the &lsquo;danger zone&rsquo; as we have very little experience of pregnancy in my family, and we think for them, knowing we&rsquo;re pregnant, only to lose it could really hurt them as it&rsquo;s been a long road for us (a story for another post) and especially as we lost our Mum just over a year ago last year we want to be kind.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now.  We&rsquo;re in The Netherlands (booked before we knew Eleanor was pregnant - sickness is playing a big role in the holiday, but salty crackers are helping.</p>
<p>Speak soon</p>
