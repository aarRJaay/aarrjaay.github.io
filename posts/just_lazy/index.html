<p>This is my experience too, I&rsquo;m not diagnosed but I&rsquo;m beginning the process through my GP who has given me a referral to <a href="https:/theowl.org">The Owl Centre</a>.  It wasn&rsquo;t until our counsellor mentioned it and ran me through some of the &lsquo;symptoms&rsquo; of Autism and ADHD (AuDHD) and then me reading articles and peoples&rsquo; real-life experiences that I&rsquo;ve realised that it is most certainly something I have, even if I don&rsquo;t get a formal diagnosis.</p>
<p>The struggles mentioned in this post and the ones people responded with sound exactly like something I could have written.  The forgetting, the not finishing, the constant mental exhaustion (and yes, I&rsquo;ve had  <strong>all</strong> the blood tests which have come back negative.  You mention you&rsquo;re tired to people and get back the &rsquo;everyone is tired&rsquo; - but I don&rsquo;t feel much better after a night&rsquo;s sleep and this is something many people with this find too.  Our brain is always on, processing, over-processing and it&rsquo;s exhausting.</p>
<p>I hate that I never finish anything and it&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t want to, I <strong>do</strong>, there&rsquo;s just some kind of mental block preventing me from doing it.</p>
<p>I often have trouble beginning tasks, not because I don&rsquo;t want to start but because things need to be right and ligned up before I can begin, or I need to be in the right head-space, sometimes it&rsquo;s something I really want to do so I want to savour it and do a good job which is now why I realise that I leave writing Bible Notes until the last minute.   I love writing them and get a lot out of them but I want to be my best when I write them and I also don&rsquo;t want to get the over and done with too soon - I want to give people something of value from them but there will also often be other things going on in my brain that I want to get out before I can fully concentraite on the notes, even if that thing is silly and trivial - it&rsquo;s still a mountain in my way before my brain is clear to produce something of value because I <strong>know</strong> the nonsense will be there gnawing at my attention whilst I&rsquo;m trying to focus.</p>
<p>I can also see that&rsquo;s something that affected my job too, I&rsquo;d purposely put things off until I was ready, but through a combination of things, I was <strong>never</strong> ready so things didn&rsquo;t get done when and how they should - I wanted them to be perfect but I never reached the perfection I needed <strong><strong>&ldquo;never let perfection be the enemy of good&rdquo;</strong></strong> (Voltaire).  I often let perfection get in the way of even <strong>starting</strong> a task, let alone finishing it and that&rsquo;s <strong>if</strong> something doesn&rsquo;t distract me from completing the task.  It certainly feels like the odds are stacked against me.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why a career shift at this point is perfect,  I&rsquo;m realising my shortcomings and the things I&rsquo;m not actually good at because my brain isn&rsquo;t actually physically built that way.  A desk job isn&rsquo;t for me - sitting doing for 9 - 5 day-in day-out isn&rsquo;t where I&rsquo;m going to thrive.  The AuDHD brain craves a certain amount of routine, but also thrives in chaos and change.  I&rsquo;m hoping that the jobs I&rsquo;m applying for are going to be compatible with that, we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think AuDHD would actually be the answer, I didn&rsquo;t want to feel like I was jumping on the bandwaggon of the hip thing to have but it genuinely fits my symptoms, the stories match my own and I feel like I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;found my people&rsquo;.  Every meme, every post has something of me in and it&rsquo;s a sigh of releaf to know that I&rsquo;m not alone, that there is an answer and a reason for it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep you posted on how things go and I&rsquo;ll certainly keep posting these memes and discussions because it&rsquo;s helping me to process and I hope it helps whoever is reading this too.</p>
