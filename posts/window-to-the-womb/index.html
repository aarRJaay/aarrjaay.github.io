I’m really excited to see our little one, but it’s mixed with some apprehension - this is technically called a ‘Viability Scan’ which is part of what we want to see - we need to be sure that our little one is okay. We’ve known we’ve been pregnant for pretty much the whole 8 weeks as Eleanor had symptoms from almost ‘Day 1’ and Eleanor is still experiencing symptoms but we just want to check - we’ve had one friend who recently had a miscarrage and another with a ‘missed’ miscarrage so we want to be super-sure things are as they should be at this early stage.">

    <p>So, today we get to see our little one for the first time.  We decided to have an 8 week scan, just to make sure everything is okay and to see how many we&rsquo;re having as our risk of multiple births is quite high to due my wife&rsquo;s age.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to see our little one, but it&rsquo;s mixed with some apprehension - this is technically called a &lsquo;Viability Scan&rsquo; which is part of what we want to see - we need to be sure that our little one is okay.  We&rsquo;ve known we&rsquo;ve been pregnant for pretty much the whole 8 weeks as Eleanor had symptoms from almost &lsquo;Day 1&rsquo; and Eleanor is still experiencing symptoms but we just want to check - we&rsquo;ve had one friend who recently had a miscarrage and another with a &lsquo;missed&rsquo; miscarrage so we want to be super-sure things are as they should be at this early stage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard at this stage they&rsquo;ll have a visible (and possibly audible) heartbeat and look like a Jelly Baby, I can&rsquo;t wait, but the event is very much tinged with the thought that something may not be okay, although there&rsquo;s no reason to believe there is a problem but we just want to be sure.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re telling some close friends today Eleanor has a group of women she meets for praryer and support, and I&rsquo;ll be meeting a friend for a curry and a catch-up, these will be the first friends here that we&rsquo;ve told.  We have told some other friends and family, but these will be the first friends from our local church to find out.  These will be our &lsquo;close support&rsquo; network and a major part of our &lsquo;village&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll let you know how it goes and hopefully post a picture.</p>
